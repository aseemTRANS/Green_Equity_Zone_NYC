# Green_Equity_Zone_NYC

### Introduction
To improve air quality, enhance aesthetic qualities, and mitigate the e7ects of urban heat islands, urban tree canopies are essential. But in NYC, these advantages are not spread equitably, with the number of trees frequently mirroring underlying socioeconomic inequalities. This policy briefing investigates the uneven distribution of tree canopies in the Neighbourhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs) in New York City and looks at the intricate connections between these canopy types and environmental and socioeconomic variables, including heat vulnerability, income, and English proficiency.

The investigation, which combines data from 2010 to 2017, reveals notable di7erences: locations with higher concentrations of minorities, greater susceptibility to heat waves, and lower socioeconomic status frequently have fewer trees, which exacerbates environmental and health inequities. To address these disparities, this briefing suggests using a Tree Equity Score to prioritise greening projects in disadvantaged areas with a goal of at least 30% canopy coverage. It is anticipated that these focused initiatives will improve living conditions, lessen urban heat, and improve air quality, all of which will contribute to greater urban equity and resilience.

### Methodology

#### Spatial Analysis: 
Visualising the geographical distribution of tree canopy coverage alongside different socio-economic and environmental factors was made possible using spatial analysis. It shows the differences between various Neighbourhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs) in an understandable visual manner by mapping these parameters.
#### Statistical analysis: 
Statistical methods like Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression are used to find correlations between tree canopy data and various indicators which include poverty, income, race, age, hvi and lack of English language.
#### Spatial Autocorrelation: 
Moran's I show that the tendency of high canopy regions to cluster together raises the possibility of differences in the distribution of urban green spaces.
#### Spatial Indexing: 
Tree Equity Scores simplify the process of prioritising the areas for tree equality based on socio-economic needs and existing tree canopy.
#### Comparative Analysis: 
Analysing a neighbourhood to see how differences in tree canopy might impact urban living conditions.
#### Analysing Tree Canopy Expansion: 
The goal of this study was to assess Hunts Point's potential tree-planting sites to raise the canopy coverage from 9% to 30%. The investigation involved using data on the current coverage of trees, land use, and urban infrastructure to identify possible planting locations using spatial mapping techniques.
